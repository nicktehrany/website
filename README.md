# My website

This is the source code for my website where I keep info on all projects and notes for my uni courses.
I build the website when I have updates and deploy it to the [remote repo](https:github.com/nicktehrany/nicktehrany.github.io)
and the website is available at [https://nicktehrany.github.io](https://nicktehrany.github.io)

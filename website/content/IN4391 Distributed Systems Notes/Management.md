## Reading Material Before Lecture

### Google Borg

Google Borg is a management system for clusters that run several hundreds of thousands of jobs from many different
applications, on many different clusters with each having several thousands machines.

### Resource Management in Cloud

Clouds contain large quantities of shared resources that provide provide these to large pools of data and compting with
a variety of different interfaces. An important part of cloud computing is resource management, as there only are finite
resources available.

### Slurm

Slurm is a cluster management and scheduling system for Linux clusters that are fault-tolerant and highly scalable, and
it is open source.

### Energy Efficient Resource Management

In order to fulfill the needs of demand on computational resources, cloud providers have to implement energy efficient
hardware and find the tradeoff between performance and energy efficiency, in order to not use enormous amounts of energy,
while still meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements.

#### What is Security?

Security means:
**C**onfidentiality: Access to  systems or dataa is limited to authorised parties.  
**I**ntegrity: WHen you receive data, you get the "right" data.  
**A**vailability: The system or data is there when you want it.  

#### Objectives of Cryptography

    - Message authentication: valid message?
    - Data origin authentication: valid sender?
    - Enitity authentication: authenticate each other for communication

Kerkhoff's principle: The adversary knows all details about the crypto system except the private key.
